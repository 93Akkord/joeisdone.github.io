# Who’s voting?

In the previous blog post at [joeisdone](http://joeisdone.github.io/), I explain why VBM analysis in 2020 is more accurately done using total voter turnout of 2016 as a comparison point. 

Today, we will take a deeper dive at the demographics of who’s voting. North Carolina publishes excellent detailed demographic crosstabs on who’s requested a ballot with columns such as race, ethnicity, age, gender, party affiliation, and county. This allows us to deduce with whom the enthusiasm gap is. 

# Summary

 Most notable is that there are strong signs that the overperformance with Democrats is partially an artifact of [Simpson’s Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox). In short, the Democrats have a registration edge with the 65+ compared with the under-65, and yet have been found to be staunch Republican voters in exit polls. 

When you have *mostly 65+* people signing up for VBM, and these mostly 65+ people are mostly Democratic even though they tend to vote for Republicans, this means that **the Democratic VBM edge is disproportionately composed of crossover voters.**

Also notable is that the enthusiasm gap with Black voters is very real. 

The biggest area of caution is around independent voters. In 2016, the independent voters broke for Trump. However, since 2016, North Carolina has gone through population growth, and the newly registered voters tend to be unaffiliated. **Hence, a strong recommendation to the Trump team is to focus on reaching out to transplants.**

# Who are the independents?

Of note is that independents have exceptionally competitive VBM sign-ups with Democrats. At their current rate, as a percentage of 2016, they will *overtake* Democrats as the party most represented in VBM statistics. 

Independents famously carried Trump to victory in 2016, but are the Independents signing up to VBM the same independents as in 2016? To answer the question, I look at *which counties* independents are requesting the most ballots in as a ratio of 2016.
