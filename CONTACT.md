I have broad programming skills, I write, and I analyze data. Industry veteran in all three. 

I will provide my services to any Republican in a competitive office on a volunteer basis for the 2020 Election, and am willing to travel if a clean room setup is needed. 

If interested, email me with proof of identity along with your expectations to jsmithrand016 (at) gmail (dot) com.
