# Joe’s Yuge Strategic Misstep

Several states have begun releasing reports on voters who have requested vote-by-mail (VBM) ballots. North Carolina, in particular, has begun publishing a daily report [here](https://tinyurl.com/y3zha9uh). 

Lockdowns have driven a surge in demand for mail-in voting. North Carolina’s mail-in requests currently stand at over *fourteen* times the demand at the same time in 2016. 

In 2016, Republicans had the advantage, requesting forty percent of all VBM ballots to the Democrats’ thirty-one percent. In 2020, Democrats hold a commanding advantage: having fifty-one percent of all VBMs to the Republicans’ 16 percent. The charts below show the difference:

*2016 vs. 2020 VBM makeup. Don’t panic. This is actually bad news for Joe.*

Should Republicans toss in the towel then? 

No! Actually, Joe Biden needs to throw in the towel. 

I will explain why. 

# The MSM has convinced Democrats voting in person is dangerous

It is well known that the MSM has made a massive push to get Americans to vote by mail. Thus far, this push has been effective on Democrats, but not so much Republican. Nate Silver says:

> According to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 30 percent of registered voters said they planned to vote by mail, and 43 percent said they planned to vote in person on Election Day. But among Trump supporters, only 11 percent said they planned to vote by mail, and 66 percent said they planned to vote in person on Election Day. Among Joe Biden backers, 47 percent said they planned to vote by mail, while only 26 percent said they planned to vote in person on Election Day. (The share who said they would vote early in person was consistently 20-21 percent among all three groups: Trump supporters, Biden supporters and voters overall.)

The percent of Democrats intending to vote by mail rises to 57% in battleground states, which have remained locked down for the most part. [Source](https://tinyurl.com/y3u2xarx)

Polls show that Democrats strongly believe that voting is a **health risk.**

Given these priors, it seems exceedingly unlikely that Democrats are inclined to go out and vote during Election Day. **Joe Biden must get the majority of Democrats to vote by mail!**

So what voting methods will voters take? [Here’s what a poll says](https://tinyurl.com/y6o8jalg):

The surveys are consistent: 

* Democrats need to have a majority to turnout by mail.
* Joe Biden’s supporters will need close to a majority to turnout by mail.
* Republicans need to have a majority to turnout on Election Day.
