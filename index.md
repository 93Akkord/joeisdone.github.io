# Joe’s Yuge Strategic Misstep

Several states have begun releasing reports on voters who have requested vote-by-mail (VBM) ballots. North Carolina, in particular, has begun publishing a daily report [here](https://tinyurl.com/y3zha9uh). 

Lockdowns have driven a surge in demand for mail-in voting. North Carolina’s mail-in requests currently stand at over *fourteen* times the demand at the same time in 2016. 

In 2016, Republicans had the advantage, requesting forty percent of all VBM ballots to the Democrats’ thirty-one percent. In 2020, Democrats hold a commanding advantage: having fifty-one percent of all VBMs to the Republicans’ 16 percent. The charts below show the difference:
